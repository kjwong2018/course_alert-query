# course_alert-query
A telegram bot that get you the class info you need and can set alert to check for open seats

<h3>Capability</h3>
* Currently it can only support around 1 - 5 people due to elements I did not implements.
* It can search up any major courses, such as CSE, MGO, EAS, PHY and more.
* It only takes the top search and display its course info.
> (I was testing it on higher level courses so I did not expect more than 1 class section, sorry)

<h3>Need Improvement</h3>
